# WPForceLogin

Copy WPForceLogin.php into your mu-plugins folder. Simply visit your website to be logged in as an administrator. I mostly use this code for development purposes. You can modify the default username and email during the class initialization (at the bottom of WPForceLogin.php). This code provides a good  example to forcing users to always be logged in no matter the page they are on. If a user tries to log out, they will be automatically logged back in.
